        such as evergreen shrubs and trees, into ornamental and decorative shapes like 
        spheres, spirals, or animals. The term can also refer to the plants that have been
         shaped this way. This horticultural practice involves meticulous and 
         repeated pruning to develop and maintain the desired form, and the 
         resulting sculpted plants can serve as striking architectural 
         features in a garden. 
        Topiary is the art of training plants (typically evergreen shrubs and trees) into intricate or stylized shapes and forms.
The term may also be used more loosely to describe a number of garden features that rely on the close clipping and shaping of plants. These include:
Parterres: Typically lavish Italian renaissance gardens would have simple, large, clipped specimens in and among statues. These would then have beautifully ornate, clipped box hedges swirling around them in mirrored patterns or geometric designs. This style of hedging is known as a parterre garden. In earlier parterre gardens the gaps in the patterns would be left open and the ground would be covered with ornamental gravel to produce a crisp clean effect. As time went on, the styles became more and more elaborate, and other plants were added to give extra colour and interest.
Mazes and labyrinths: The Normans introduced pleasure gardens with mazes and labyrinths formed from clipped plants. A number of private and public gardens still have such features today.
Knot gardens: Topiary gardens became very popular in Great Britain during the reign of the Tudors and Stuarts. During this period knot gardens and clipped ornate shapes were introduced to gardens up and down the country. The knot garden was formed from different coloured box, planted in crisscrossing patterns so that it appeared that the ribbons of hedges had been tied up in knots. Highly-scented herbs were also used as hedging plants, planted in and among the gaps to give a tapestry of colour.   
Topiary is still used today in many modern styles, as there is always room for a clipped masterpiece.
